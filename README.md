# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
<!-- Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis: The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt) -->
The purpose of this analysis was to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to determine which model will be best to predict credit card risk. Oversampling was done using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms. BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier was used to reduce bias and predict credit risk. Once the analysis is complete, we will recommened which model should be used.
